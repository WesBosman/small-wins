# small-wins

A website that I use on my phone to keep track of when I spend money.

## Goals

The goal of this project was to create something small that could be built and deployed quickly on a small VPS.

### Future Development

- [ ] Add https
- [ ] Make it theme-able using settings
- [ ] Add a way to restore default settings
- [ ] Add a way to delete items / categories

I ended up renaming the project to KeepingScore because I already had the domain.

You can find the project here
